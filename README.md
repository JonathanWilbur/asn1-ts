**Version 1.0.0 has not been released yet, meaning that I, as the maker of this
library, strongly advise against using this in anything production-facing.**

This library was based off of my [D ASN.1 Library](https://github.com/JonathanWilbur/asn1-d),
so please forgive me if there are mistakes in the documentation that refer to
D files or D concepts.

## What is ASN.1?

ASN.1 stands for *Abstract Syntax Notation*. ASN.1 was first specified in
[X.680 - Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.680/en),
by the [International Telecommunications Union](https://www.itu.int/en/pages/default.aspx).
ASN.1 messages can be encoded in one of several encoding/decoding standards.
It provides a system of types that are extensible, and can presumably describe
every protocol. You can think of it as a protocol for describing other protocols
as well as a family of standards for encoding and decoding said protocols.
It is similar to Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/),
or Sun Microsystems' [External Data Representation (XDR)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1014).

For more information on what ASN.1 is, see `documentation/asn1.md`.

## Why ASN.1?

ASN.1 is used in, or required by, multiple technologies, including:

* [X.509 Certificates](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509-201610-I/en), used in [SSL/TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246)
* [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt)
* [X.400](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.400/en), the messaging system used by the U.S. Military
* [X.500](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.500-201610-I/en)
* The [magnetic stripes](https://www.iso.org/standard/43317.html) on credit cards and debit cards
* Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt242409.aspx)
* [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1157.txt)
* [Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.711/en)
* [Signalling System Number 7 (SS7)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.700-199303-I/en),
  used to make most phone calls on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
* [Kerberos 5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4120)
* [H.323](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.323-200912-I/en) Video conferencing
* Biometrics Protocols:
  * [BioAPI Interworking Protocol (BIP)](https://www.iso.org/standard/43611.html)
  * [Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF)](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir6529-a.pdf)
  * [Authentication Contexts for Biometrics (ACBio)](https://www.iso.org/standard/41531.html)
* [Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA)](https://www.ecma-international.org/activities/Communications/TG11/cstaIII.htm)
* [Dedicated Short Range Communications (SAE J2735)](http://standards.sae.org/j2735_200911/)
* Cellular telephony:
  * [Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](http://www.ttfn.net/techno/smartcards/gsm11-11.pdf)
  * [Global Packet Radio Service (GPRS) / Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE)](http://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/102-gprs-edge)
  * [Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UTMS)](http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/25-series.htm)
  * [Long-Term Evolution (LTE)](http://www.3gpp.org/technologies/keywords-acronyms/98-lte)

If you look in the
[`asn1` directory of WireShark's source code](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/tree/master/epan/dissectors/asn1),
you'll see all of the protocols that use ASN.1.

This list can also be found in `documentation/asn1.d`.

## Why *This* Library?

You should use *this* library, because ASN.1 is _really_ difficult to implement,
and ASN.1 is _really_ _really_ difficult to implement **to specification**, and
ASN.1 is _really_ _really_ _really_ difficult to implement **securely**. I spent
at least over 1000 hours in 2017 working on this library to make sure it is
implemented to specification and implemented securely. This library has been
subjected to about 4.3 billion random inputs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux,
as well as over 100,000 unit tests. I have also reviewed _all_ CVE's from the
[National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/)'s
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) that are related to
ASN.1 and related codecs. Further, I documented this library so well that,
unlike so many other libraries out there, you should not need to look at the
source code--the included documentation and the generated HTML documentation
should be sufficient. This library is **unambiguously** the best ASN.1 library
in any programming language **ever**.

I will repeat myself: **I do not recommend that you implement your own ASN.1 library**,
but if you are still considering it, please first:

1. Let me know why. If you have good ideas, I will be more than happy to implement
them in this library.
1. Let me know where I can find your library. I will constructively criticize it
with such ferocity that, if your ancestors live to tell the tale, they will do so
for millenia to come. **I guarantee you** that you will screw up and leave a
security vulnerability in your code if you aren't just copying and pasting from my code.

## Library Usage

For each codec in the library, usage entails instantiating the class,
then using that class' properties to get and set the encoded value.
For all classes, the empty constructor creates an `END OF CONTENT`
element. The remaining constructors will be codec-specific.

Here is a TypeScript example of encoding with Basic Encoding Rules, using the
`BERElement` class.

```typescript
let el : BERElement = new BERElement();
el.typeTag = ASN1UniversalType.integer;
el.integer = 1433; // Now the data is encoded.
console.log(el.integer); // Logs '1433'
```

... and here is how you would decode that same element:

```typescript
let encodedData : Uint8Array = el.toBytes();
let el2 : BERElement = new BERElement();
el2.fromBytes(encodedData);
console.log(el2.integer); // Logs '1433'
```

<!-- For more information on usage of the library, see `documentation/library.md`,
`documentation/security.md`, `documentation/concurrency.md`. After that, see
the compiler-generated HTML documentation in `documentation/html` for even
more detail. -->

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Fix infinite recursion vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement a Distinguished Encoding Rules Codec
- [ ] Implement a Canonical Encoding Rules Codec
- [ ] Build all codecs separately
- [x] Make each codec inherit from `ASN1Element`
- [x] Use longer names with aliases
- [x] Improve the system of exceptions
- [ ] Make `fromBytes` return negative numbers to signal issues.
- [ ] Make concurrency possible by making the `recursionCount`s non-static.
- [ ] More time type testing
